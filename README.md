# email-to-codecommit
A Lambda function that parses an email from S3 into a CodeCommit Zettelkasten repo

If you use this, you'll want to replace `EMAIL_HERE` and `<NAME_HERE>` in the code with something useful. Mine is the email address I send stuff to - no, I'm not going to tell you what that is :)
